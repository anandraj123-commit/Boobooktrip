                description: 'The Cellular Jail, also known as Kala Pani, is a famous colonial prison in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The prison was used by the British government of India for the purpose of exiling criminals and political prisoners. Many freedom fighters were imprisoned here during the struggle for India’s independence. Today, the complex serves as a national memorial monument. The Cellular Jail is located in Port Blair and there is also a museum attached to the jail complex. The unique and intimidating structure of this massive colonial prison is as petrifying as the stories it holds. The Prison had seven wings and a tower at the center which was used by guards to keep watch on the inmate. Without a doubt, this structure is one of the most historically prominent buildings in India. For this reason and intent, Cellular Jail is a must-visit spot during your Andaman trip',
